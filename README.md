# CustomSnackBarDemo
This sample app shows a custom snackbar. 

Screenshot is attached to the repository.

# Updates :
Lottie animations added, with few samples, very easy code to implement, also the snackbar wasn't compatiable with the coordinator layout so I've made few chnages in the code, which will support coordinator easily. 

# Future updates:
Soon code will be converted into kotlin ‚ù§ :)
